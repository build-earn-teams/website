# 🌐 Build & Earn

**Build & Earn** is a freelancing platform built by students, for students.
It’s a place where college developers and designers can collaborate on real-world projects, connect with clients, and earn while learning.

---

## 🚀 About the Platform

We started **Build & Earn** with a simple idea — to give students real project exposure and fair earning opportunities while still in college.
Instead of working alone on side projects, here you can join a team, take up freelance work from real clients, and grow together.

This repository (`website`) contains the complete codebase of the platform — both frontend and backend.

## 🎯 What We Believe

> Learning hits differently when it’s real, paid, and shared with a team.
> Build & Earn is where you turn your college skills into real experience and earnings.
